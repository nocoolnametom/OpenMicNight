The basic idea would be that once a month or so we’d open up for scheduling episodes for the next month and it would be first-come-first-served in terms of which spot you wanted.  An “understudy” spot could also be chosen in case the first claimant bails, and all entries would have to be turned in at a predetermined time beforehand.  If an entry is not turned in before the deadline, then the understudy gets a much smaller deadline (hopefully you’re prepared like any good understudy would be!), and if that doesn’t work then there’s simply no episode for that time.

Perhaps we might feature a Last Minute Raffle the day before on the days when the understudy also cannot fulfill.  If the rules for sign-up are set up beforehand, much of the process can be easily automated.  This web application would also be the publicly-facing side of the podcast, and voting and comments can be placed on the site.  Obviously, we’d try and get an automatic posting back to the subreddit when a new episode is released.

It’s open mic night!
