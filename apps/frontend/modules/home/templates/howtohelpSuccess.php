<h2>How to Help</h2>
<div>The beta will begin in a few months and will be open to all Subreddits to
    participate in. Until that time there's a number of things that need
    help.</div>
<h3>Template Assistance</h3>
<div>I'm a programmer, not a designer.  While I think the current look and feel
    is rather snazzy, I understand that it's <em>very</em> sub-par.  This site
    needs a much more unified and unique look to it that speaks to the ideas of
    fun, individual expression, and Reddit.  It needs fun JQuery and JQueryUI
    bells and whistles.  I can work with integration of visual improvements to
    the site, so if you're interested, have any idea, or want to show off
    anything please
    <?php include_partial('global/feedback_link', array('feedback_text' => 'drop me a note')) ?>.</div>
<h3>Copy Editing</h3>
<div>Just as I'm not a designer, I'm also not a copy editor.  This front page
    will be the first thing many people see when they arrive at the site.  They
    need to understand the concept of scheduled and organized podcasts centered
    around subreddit communities and to know why they would enjoy participating.
    If you want suggestions for improvement to the copy of the site, please
    <?php include_partial('global/feedback_link', array('feedback_text' => 'let me know')) ?>.</div>
<h3>Legal Assistance</h3>
<div>Since we're dealing with audio files that can be shared with thousands of
    people, the opportunities for copyright infringement need to be dealt with.
    The approval process seems to me to be a great tool to shift responsibility
    onto the various subreddits, but I am uncertain of the specific legal
    ramifications should someone attempt to shared audio content they do not
    have the rights to.  And yet other sites such as Imgur are able to deal with
    similar issues.  If you know of anyone with legal expertise in this area or
    want to offer advice or suggestions, please
    <?php include_partial('global/feedback_link', array('feedback_text' => 'let me know')) ?>.</div>
<h3>The Name</h3>
<div>Yeah, I'm aware that the subdomain of the site is currently "openmicnight"
    and that the name is currently displayed as "Herddit".  I'm not very good
    with names; OpenMicNight was the first name I came up with, and I thought
    that Herddit was a fun play on the name "Reddit".  However, I may not have a
    good grasp on such things.  If you have a suggestion for a good name for the
    site, even if it's one of those crazy off-the-wall Web 2.0 type names so
    popular nowadays, please
    <?php include_partial('global/feedback_link', array('feedback_text' => 'suggest a name')) ?>,
    making sure to explain why you think the name is good.</div>
<h3>A Job</h3>
<div>Finally, I'd like to think that I'm a pretty good backend web programmer.
    I'm proficient in PHP, good with C#, comfortable with Java and Python, and
    prefer Linux.  I'm always on the lookout for a good job where I can work a
    good 40 hours but still have a life outside of work with my family.  And
    anything that is available outside of Utah would be nice, too.  I know it's
    probably a long shot, but if you have any openings or know of any openings
    for a web programmer please
    <?php include_partial('global/feedback_link', array('feedback_text' => 'send me a note')) ?>.
