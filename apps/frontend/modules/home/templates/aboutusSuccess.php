        <h3>Tom Doggett</h3>
        <h4>Currently Everyman<br/>Lead Developer, Designer, Programmer,
            Creator, Owner, and Ruler</h4>
        <p>I'd like to think that I'm a pretty good backend web programmer. I'm
            proficient in PHP, good with C#, comfortable with Java and Python,
            and prefer Linux (my distro of choice currently being Arch).</p>
        <p>I'm familiar with the use and development of RESTful APIs, the Amazon
            Web Services (mostly dealing with S3), and a bit of Apache
            configuration.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy a lot of more off-the-wall things.  I am comfortable in
            using LaTeX, and I enjoy studying Ancient Greek and attempting to
            become good enough that I can just sit down and read it without much
            use of a dictionary.  I get a strange thrill out of being able to
            read original sources when it comes to ancient history.</p>
        <p>I'm always on the lookout for a good job where I can work a good 40
            hours but still have a life outside of work with my family.  And
            anything that is available outside of Utah would be nice, too.  I
            know it's probably a long shot, but if you have any openings or know
            of any openings for a web programmer or a junior sysadmin that work
            with that please

                'feedback_text' => 'send me a note',
                )) ?>.</p>
