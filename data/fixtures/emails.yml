      <p>Dear ~name~,</p>
      
      <p>You need to authorize your Reddit username.  This is because you have either
      changed the email address or password of your account, or because you have
      not previously authorized your username since registering for
      ~app_name~.</p>
      
      <p>You can verify your Reddit username by responding with the following Reddit
      activation key:</p>
      <blockquote>~valid_key~</blockquote>
      <p> as a reply to a post in the ~app_name~ Subreddit:</p>
      <blockquote>~reddit_post~</blockquote>
      
      <p>Once you've posted your key, verification shouldn't take more than an hour
      or two.  We'll do our best to let you know if there are any problems that
      might take longer.</p>

      <p>Dear ~name~,</p>
      
      <p>There is an episode that has been submitted for approval in the
      ~subreddit_name~ subreddit.  Please take some time to listen to this episode
      and determine if you feel you can approve it. Remember that all episodes must
      be submitted by users who own or adhere to rules governing the rights to all
      content contained within.  Creative Commons content should be correctly
      attributed, and it's safer to avoid relying on "fair use" defenses by
      avoiding the use of copyrighted materials altogether, though it's up to you
      as an approver to decide that.  Remember that it your approval of this
      episode means that it complies with the aims of your subreddit as well as
      copyright laws.</p>
      
      <p>Please take the time needed to approve this episode or to send it back to the
      submitter for further work.  Be honest and be fair.  There's a lot of
      responsibility resting upon you, but you know that you're up to it; you
      wouldn't be a moderator otherwise.  Have fun, and help someone else give
      their voice to the world!</p>

      <p>Dear ~name~,</p>
      
      <p>It's been a week since you registered for an account at ~app_name~.  You
      still need to verify your Reddit username, however.  You can do this by
      posting your Reddit activation key:</p>
      <blockquote>~valid_key~</blockquote>
      <p> as a reply to a post in the ~app_name~ Subreddit:</p>
      <blockquote>~reddit_post~</blockquote>
      
      <p>Once you've posted your key, verification shouldn't take more than an hour or
      two.  We'll do our best to let you know if there are any problems that might
      take longer.</p>
      
      <p>Since it's been a week, we should let you know that this will be the last 
      email sent to you about verifying your Reddit account.  We don't want to
      bother you, so we'll back off.  If you need to try again in the future,
      you'll be able to start this process off again from within your user
      preferences at ~app_name~.</p>
      
      <p>We hope you'll join us soon!</p>
