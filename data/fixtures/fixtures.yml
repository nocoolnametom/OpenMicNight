# The following is the web app API key and shared secret - alter them for
# production.  Keep it secret, keep it safe.  Ensure that the api key is present
# in the API's config/app.yml file.  This will prevent users from revoking their
# own access to the web app or getting a login notification from the web app
# upon every login (which couldget annoying).  The config/app.yml also controls
# the length of time that thelogin authkey is valid for each user, depending on
# whether they select"Remember Me" or not.
#
# The web app also contains the same API key and shared secret in its
# config/app.yml file.  Make sure to match the values here in there, as well.
